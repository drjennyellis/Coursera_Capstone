    "# Hotel Recommendations Based on Popular Nearby Venues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Traveling can always incite stress, whether it is planning for the trip or while on the trip. One area people put a lot of thought into is what hotel to stay at when traveling to a new location. Whether traveling for business or pleasure, people may know they want to stay near a particular venue. Often, there are several hotels located nearby. Cost may be the primary reason people choose a hotel, but if there are several hotels in a particular location with similar prices, how does one choose so that they are likely happy where they stay?\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone has different tastes and preferences. Often, the extent to which someone is happy where they stay is impacted by the surrounding area. Some people may prefer hotels with a variety of restaurants and shopping. Others may prefer a hotel that is near places with sights to see and things to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem and Audience\n",
    "The problem is that when searching for a place to stay, travelers can get good information on a hotel's price, ratings, and ammenities but know very little about the area surrounding the hotel. One of the worst experiences for a traveler is arriving at a hotel to discover there are no restaurants in walking distance and the traveler does not have a car! Travelers can look up each hotel they are interested in through Google and look at what's nearby. However, if a traveler has multiple hotels to choose from in different areas, it can be difficult to remember and manually track the nearby venues and which areas might be the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to identify groups of hotels in the Toronto, Canada area based on the popular venues located nearby for would-be travelers to Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "To provide detailed hotel information to help travelers figure out where to stay in Toronto, Canada, the data is from hotels.com and foursquare. To obtain the price of one night in November (to ensure few were sold out) at Toronto hotels, I scraped hotels.com using selenium. To provide travelers with an estimate of hotel prices, I searched for hotels in Toronto for one night (Friday to Saturday) with 2 adults in mid November 2020 sorted by distance from city center. The three pieces of information scraped from hotels.com were hotel name, hotel address, and hotel price.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were several different types of foursquare data pulled using the API. One dataset used the first two words of the hotel names from the hotels.com data to search for these specific hotels in the foursquare data. This foursquare data provided the venue ID for each hotel in order to obtain venue details for each hotel. The combined data from hotels.com and foursquare provides hotel name and address, price information, ratings, latitude and longitude, and contact information. The other data from foursquare consisted of venues within a 500 meter radius around each hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "Before data could be merged together, each dataset had to be cleaned. The hotel information scraped from hotels.com had price data as a string because it included text on how many rooms were left at a certain price. The price values were extracted from the price column and turned into an integer class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset from foursquare was reduced to include the columns: id, name, category name, location.address, location.lat, and location.lng. The variables that were dropped either had NaN values or were not relevant to goal of this project. To match the correct hotels from hotels.com with the foursquare, I used the location address to identify which foursquare data to merge with the hotels.com data to create a new dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next dataset from foursquare involved getting the details for each hotel. The detailed information from foursquare allows me to provide travelers with the average venue rating and total number of likes as additional pieces of information to make an informed decision. The detailed information also includes the venue url and contact phone. This data was merged with the new merged data set to have a dataset with complete hotel information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last dataset from foursquare involved getting the venues within a 500 meter radius around each hotel. Because this data also included hotels, hotels were removed from this dataset. The data were then transformed to a new dataset that showed the top 10 most common venues for each hotel. To do this transformation, each venue was dummy coded to get the mean frequency of each venue for each hotel. The mean frequency was then used to identify the top 10 most common venues for each hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hotels.com Data\n",
    "I used selenium to scrape the hotels.com data. After searching for the parameters described in **Data Sources** above, the resulting url was used for scraping. One issue with this particular website was that it didn't provide the results in pages but used infinite scrolling. If the code did not account for the infinite scrolling, it only scraped the first 10 results. After taking into account the infinite scrolling, the script scraped 138 hotels in the Toronto area.  "

Another look at the search page from hotels.com revealed that two hotels were sold out. These two hotels were removed from hotel names and addresses. Next, the three variables were combined into a dataframe of hotel name, address, and price. Price included text because the scraping captured words like \"Only 3 left at this price.\" The price was always at the end of the string, so I used regular expressions to extract the numbers at the end of the string that represented the price. I then created a new dataframe to drop the original price variable and rename the cleaned up price variable."

I also only needed the id, name, location.address, location.lat, and location.lng from this foursquare data set so I reduced it to contain only the variables I needed."

For example, are higher priced hotels more likely to be surrounded by a large number of venues? The heatmap shows that hotels that are $200 or less are more likely to have less than 20 nearby venues. Hotels greater than $200 were more likely to have 80-100 nearby venues and were never in areas with less than 20 venues. There were some hotels that cost less than $200 a night that were in areas with 21-100 nearby venues."

    "There were 76 hotels within the blue cluster contained a wide variety of places to eat and things to do. Common places included coffee shops and cafes, a variety of places to eat, shopping, gyms, spas, and bars. If someone wanted to stay at a hotel near a variety of things to do and place to eat, hotels in the blue cluster would be the place to stay. \n",

    "In addition, these hotels were not located in one area of Toronto. While many were in downtown Toronto, there were plenty of choices near the airport, Vaughn, and Markham. Depending on people's reasons to visit Toronto, they would likely find a hotel with a variety of options nearby. Hotel prices in this cluster ranged from $40 to $453. The average hotel price was $142.97. Fifty-percent of the hotels in this cluster were less than $125. The average rating for hotels in this cluster was 7.0 and the average number of likes was 50."

    "The results of this analysis show that the combination of foursquare data and hotel price data can help travelers make an informed decision on the best place to stay for their trips. Toronto, Canada was used as a test case in this analysis to determine if it was possible segment hotels based on the types of venues near hotels and then provide travelers with additional information about estimated hotel price, ratings, and likes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hotels in Toronto fell into four different groups. A majority of the hotels (66%) were in the blue cluster which had a lot of variety in terms of eating, drinking, and things to do within walking distance. For travelers who may not want to rent a car and plan to stay within walking distance of their hotel should choose hotels in the blue cluster. There was a wide range of hotel prices within the blue cluster giving travelers with different sized budgets access to these hotels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eighteen percent of hotels fell within the purple cluster. These hotels also had some variety for eating and caffinated drinks. These hotels may be ideal for short work trips where a traveler just needs some of the basics (e.g., food and drink) for their stay. These hotels ranged on the lower end of hotel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eleven percent of hotels fell in the red cluster. These hotels had plenty of coffee shops, but only limited types of places to eat. If someone had to stay in a hotel in this cluster, whether because hotels in the other cluster were sold out or they wanted to be near an event venue, they would at least know they may need a rental car or some sort of transportation for any dining, drinking, or shopping needs. The price range for these hotels was almost as big as hotels in the blue cluster. The higher priced hotels may be due to their proximity to event venues making it even more important for travelers to know that while they are paying a high price for a hotel, there are few venues within walking distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth and smallest group consisted of hotels (4%) in the yellow cluster. Surprisingly, these hotels had a variety in terms of eating and shopping and were in the lower range of hotel prices. Most of the hotels in this cluster were near the airport, which means there is some variety of places to eat within walking distance when a traveler wants to stay near the airport. \n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "A traveler coming to Toronto will probably want to focus on the hotels in the blue cluster as their first choice. Hotels in this cluster are located in various places throughout Toronto, and have a variety of prices to appeal to any budget. On average, they are more highly rated and have more likes than hotels in the other clusters. These hotels also have a variety of drinking, dining, shopping, and activities within walking distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a traveler isn't able to book a hotel within the blue cluster, the next best cluster of hotels would be the red ones. These had the second highest average ratings and a range of prices that would appeal to any budget. The one downside to hotels in this cluster was that there were not a lot of places to eat nearby or things to do. A traveler staying here would need to have some transportation if they wanted some variety in drinking, dining, shopping, and/or activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be a useful feature for travel companies to offer their travel clients. By using a combination of detailed foursquare data and hotel price data, they could provide an interactive map that shows the different hotel clusters. The map provides an easy way for travelers to focus on a particular area and then choose a hotel where a pop-up reveals the name, price, rating, likes, hotel phone, and hotel URL. \n",
